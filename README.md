# Ethereum example contracts
This repo contains example smart contracts which can be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
They contain simple examples of basic functions which smart contracts can handle, nothing fancy so far.

You can compile and run these examples using the Solidity IDE: REMIX on http://remix.ethereum.org.

Documentation about each contract can be found in the contracts themselves.
